# Building-an-Accident-prediciton-model-using-hetrogeneous-sparse-data-
This project implements supervised ML models using a 
country wide dataset to accurately predict the risk of 
accidents. This information can be provided to ground 
response teams like police forces, emergency response teams 
to be prepared for appropriate probable adversities. Also, 
urban planners can utilize this data to identify potential 
frequent points of accident and design road networks 
appropriately. In the future as the amount of data collection 
increases we would be able to obtain more important 
contextual information in real time which would aid in 
building models that predict accident severity accurately
